# skim manual (20m)

 * buffer of lines, with a current line (need both for testing correctness)
 * commands have zero, one or two addresses (each specifying a line)
 * ., $, 123 seem easy.  first line is 0 or 1 ? ... answer is 1
 * let's skip named addresses for now
 * address /re/ seems moderately easy
 * ditto ?re?
 * various addressing tricks, attack them one at a time
 * skip the "addr ; addr" trick for now, just support ,
 * commands:
 	a - append
	b - browse (print a 'page')
	c - change - delete, then replace
	d - delete
	e,E - replace buffer with file (remember filename)
	r,w,W - read/write/append file
	f - print filename
	g,v - global regex
	s - regex substitute
	i - insert 
	j - join
	k - mark address
	l - list
	m - move
	t - transfer (copy range to address)
	p - print
	q,Q - quit
	u - undo!
	= - print line number of dot
	
	interrupt - escape
 * when reading, discard NULs and all after last newline.
 
# plan (10m)

 * want a buffer with lines and dot (current line)
 * need to parse commands into addresses, command (letter), extra params
 * buffer needs to convert address descriptions into line numbers
 * commands will be functions which operate on a buffer
 * for testing want a nice representation of buffer (lines + .).  Simplest
 	might be: linenum\nline1\n...
 * want a main to wrap around buffer, command loop
 * build up tests for: command parser, address resolver, each command
 * start with e(dit) p(print) and trivial (line number) addresses, build up

# command parser (start 3:57, )

 * needs to work interactively, i.e. know where one command ends, the next finishes
 * Given a Reader and a chan Command, run until reader exits (when we close the chan)
 * can test by wrapping text in a Reader, draining the Chan.
